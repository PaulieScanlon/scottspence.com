I built my first PC, here's how it went and what I learned.

Up until recently I was very happy with my home computer, which was an
[ASUS Transformer Pro T304UA].

That was until the CPU fan started grinding against the internals,
this caused the CPU to heat up more making the fan spin faster to try
cool it causeing an even louder grinding noise.

## Why get a PC

The situation with my ASUS Transformer sort of forced the issue this
time but I have historically gone with a laptop, before the
Transformer I had another ASUS laptop with an i5 processor and 8GB of
RAM which was lasted me from ~2013-2016.

I'd been looking at building my own PC for some time, I have a Google
Sheets, sheet which shows as last edited May 4th 2013 ðŸ˜®

For me there's always been the unknown of whether the parts will fit
together as you're spending a fair bit of money on what feels like a
gamble.

## Replacement parts

Regarding the fan on the Transformer, it's a sealed unit making a part
replacement someting I'd either have to get specialist tools for or
send it off somewhere to be serviced.

After watching YouTube teardown videos I decided against attempting a
repair myself.

The first half of the video is getting the adhesive loose with a heat
gun, the rest was trying to remove screws and clips with one hand
whilst holding the screen that is connected main unit with the other
hand.

> I decided that I didn't want to be in this position again.

## What do you want to do with it?

The first question a lot of seasoned PC builders will ask in response
to you saying you want to build a PC is "what do you want to do with
it?"

For me it's mainly code, some streaming and video editing. That helps
determine the hardware you'll need.

## What type of aesthetic do you want?

I have no room to spare for a large tower PC so I decided to go with a
Mini ITX compatable case.

The case you choose will be a determining factor in the parts you can
have in there.

## PC Part Picker

Enter [PC Part Picker] this site is a MASSIVE help when it comes to
picking compatabel parts for your PC build.

This was my guide when I came to picking parts and building my system.
There are _loads_ of [completed builds] where enthusiasts and
beginners just like myself would post their completed builds and
coresponding parts list on PC Part Picker.

If there is a specific system you have in mind chances are someone has
already built it and posted their completed build here.

## Decide on what to get

So, I had a shopping list of things I needed to get. I wanted someting
a bit more powerful than the Inter Core i7 (two cores, four threads)
that was in the ASUS Transformer, with a bump to the 16GB of RAM it
had.

From watching YouTube a _lot_ I found that AMD was leading the way in
CPU performance per Â£ and the Ryzen chips where where it's at right
now.

The chip I chose was the Ryzen 5 2600 3.4 AF

## Get the parts

## Build the thing

## It's still basic .af

Needs a better CPU fan, the case PSU cables are ugly, needs more
storage
