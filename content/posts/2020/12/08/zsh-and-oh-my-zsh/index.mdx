Sooooooo, so, so, so, Zsh is pretty neat, right?

I've been a long time fan of the Fish shell, but I recently had to go
full on with a Zsh shell and decided to give it a proper go.

The main selling points for Fish shell to me over anything else was
one not having to prefix directory changes with a `cd` all the time,
just typing out the path you wanted to go to would offer up auto
suggest of paths to use.

That was enough to have me sold on it, there's also abbreviations and
aliases all super nice to use and that is pretty much the extent of
the sort of perks I like to have.

## Themes

## Plugins

## Where do they go?

Plugins and themes, some are really not that helpful (documentation
wise) when it comes to installing them.

But hey it's open source so if you're not happy you can always ask for
your money back, right? ðŸ˜‚

If the instruction is along the lines of, clone the repo then there is
a path you can specify when cloning it.

This is the clone location for `zsh-syntax-highlighting` that can be
swapped out with the theme/plugin you're using, just be sure to swap
out `plugins` with `themes` if you're cloning a theme.

```bash
git clone \
  https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting \
  ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```
