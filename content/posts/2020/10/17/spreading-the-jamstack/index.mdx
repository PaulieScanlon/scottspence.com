I have delivered this talk several times now but not actually written
about it.

Sooooo, let's talks about the jamstack!

Jamstack not JAMstack, Netlify have recently decided that there's a
bit of confusion around the capitalisation of the jam, more on this
shortly.

But first the obligatory preamble to qualify me for giving this
information to you.

I have been a professional web developer for <DateDistance
date={`2018-03-08`} /> now and in that time I have been getting
familiar with the jamstack.

I work at large digital agency that is using the jamstack in several
project currently in production. Large scale projects with 10's of
thousands of users.

I have evangelised the adoption of the jamstack wherever I saw there
was an advantage to using it.

## What is the Jamstack?

It's JavaScript APIs and Markup

Javascript === browserside

APIS === the backend for the browser

(pre rendered) Markup === html, css, markdown, templating languages

Specifically, markup in the Jamstack terminology refers to
‚Äúpre-rendered‚Äù markup or content served in its final form, HTML.

One interesting this is that none of these technologies are new.

Using these technologies together is the term stack

Let's looks at some other stacks

LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)

MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS)

MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS)

These technologies generate the template for the pages you're going to
see on the fly on a server somewhere.

Notice that the technologies are specific?

With the Jamstack your not bound to a certain framework

Let's take a look at some static site generators:

Jekyll

11ty

Gatsby

Nuxt

The core philosophy is to generate as much as you can at build time
then serve that statically from a CDN.

Anything that generates static HTML then fetches data from an API can
be termed jamstack.

The distinction here is the delivery mechanism of content. Within the
Jamstack model, content is not delivered dynamically via a web server
tasked with building pages at runtime. Rather, markup is prebuilt
upfront and served to the browser via a CDN.

Three different types of pages,

1. totally static like a landing page,

2. build time, referred to as prerendering, data for this is usually
   sitting somewhere else like a Markdown file a CMS or an API
   somewhere. Build a template somewhere and use the data to populate
   the template.

3. Data that is either stale or can't be added at build time, like
   user generated data, in this case you use a loading indicator
   whilst you retrieve the data from the API.

## Advantages

Cheaper or easier scaling

Better performance, the caveat being for dynamic data where the static
files will be served from the CDN then making an API request to ge the
data, in this case server side rendering would be faster.

Higher security

Better DX

## When to use it

Main consideration would be SEO

Is the content you need SEO for dynamic?

Yes === SSR

No === Jamstack

## What does that mean then?

## Performance matters

High performing sites retain visitors more than low performing ones.

Here's some information from Google's web.dev blog on [Why does speed
matter].

Pinterest reduced perceived wait times by 40% and this increased
search engine traffic and sign-ups by 15%.

Perceived wait times are achieved by prerendering part of the page.

> Search engine traffic and signups increased by **15%** - Pinterest

Studies have also shown the negative impact poor performance can have
on business goals. For example, the BBC found they lost an additional
10% of users for every additional second their site took to load.

> BBC found they lost an additional **10%** of users for every
> additional second their site took to load

- It's nice to get a bit of feedback
- Who knows what Jamstack is
- Who cares?
- Hopefully by the end you will care more

- First up! It's not JAMstack anymore

- It's Jamstack
- The creator of the term and his company have decided it's Jamstack
- Coined back in 2016 by Netlify CEO Matt Billman
- More on the reasoning for the name in a bit

- There's now a logo

## What's a Jamstack? ü§î

- JavaScript
- APIs
- Markup

- The holy trinity of web development
- The Jamstack is not about specific technologies.
- Like, LAMP, MEAN, MERN, whatever
- It's more a paradigm of how to deploy
- a way of building websites and apps that helps deliver:

- better performance,
- more secured projects,
- lower cost of scaling,
- and MOST IMPORTANTLY a better developer experience.
- I say MOST IMPORTANTLY as a developer, but ultimately it will lead
  to a better user experience.

## JavaScript

- Any dynamic programming during the request/response cycle is handled
  by JavaScript,
- running entirely on the client (the browser).
- This could be any frontend framework, library, or even vanilla
  JavaScript.

## APIs

- All server-side processes or database actions are abstracted into
  reusable APIs,
- accessed over HTTPS with JavaScript.
- These can be custom-built or leveraged third-party services.

## Markup

- Templated markup should be prebuilt at deploy time,
- usually using a site generator for content sites,
- or a build tool for web apps.

## AKA Static Sites

- static site generators, SSGs
- when you think about static sites what do you think?

## Static

## What is static?

- if we look at the dictionary definition
- Static (loaded term) - lacking movement, action or change

## Is my project Jamstack?

- When is your site not built with the Jamstack?
- Does it depend on a web server?
- A site built with a server-side CMS like WordPress, Drupal or
  Squarespace.
- A monolithic server-run web app that relies on Ruby, Node, or
  another backend language.
- A single page app that uses isomorphic rendering to build views on
  the server at runtime.
- Back to the Jamstack though

## Jamstack

- It's not the experience
- It's the architecture
- why is that important though?

- why is that important though?
- slight tangent now

## Perf

- Performance matters

## Speed

## üê¢

## People want things fast

- Perf has been a factor in Google's ranking algorithm since 2010
- That's not news,
- people are using mobile devices a lot more now for everything
- there are two indexes, desktop and mobile
- perf will affect...

## How users interact with your site

## and it _will_ impact rankings

## Click through rates

## Time spent on page

## Return rates

- returning users

## Bounce Rates & Conversions

## where it _really_ matters

## üí∑ üí≥ üí∏ ü§ë

- emoji here to emphasise the importance
- so...

## How fast is fast enough?

## 2 seconds ‚è±

- apparently
- let's take a look at an infographic...

- this slide is from a think with Google post,
- on mobile industry benchmarks (from 2018)
- from 2018 so this has probably decreased
- Just under a third of potential visitors lost after three seconds

## Back to static

## Perf

No work at request time.

##### for the content that's not dynamic

- Static means
- No work to be done at request time

## Security

Much smaller attack surface to secure and protect

- lets look at an example of how that works

## _Dynamic_

- Browser üëÄ
- ‚¨á
- CDN üåê
- ‚¨á
- Load balancer ‚öñ
- ‚¨á
- Web server ü§π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- ‚¨á
- Database server ‚Äçü§π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- ‚¨áüîÉ
- Browser üëÄ

- simplified example
- Some resources that may be on a CDN
- Or an origin server that is sitting behind a
- AWS load balancer,
- and there'll be logic on there to route the request
- to one of maybe several web servers
- Web server for server things
- Then there may be a request for things to render from a database
- then imagine this as a round trip

## _Jamstack_

- Browser üëÄ
- ‚¨á
- CDN üåê
- ‚¨á
- Browser üëÄ

- CDN
- this can be enriched further with the A in the Jamstack
- The Gatsby team refer to this as the content mesh
- have your prebuilt site and enrich further with services
- and micro-services
- these can be leveraged directly in the browser
- or at build time

## Empower

## front end developers

- much smaller stack
- fewer things for the developer to manage

## Powered

## By modern browsers

- the capabilities they have

## Enhanced

## By a rich ecosystem of services

- Now.sh, Netlify
- GraphCMS, Strapi
- Snipcart, stripe

## Impact

## Processes and organisation

## Static Site Generators

## JavaScript

### Gatsby.js

### Next.js

- I've made it this far without mentioning any frameworks
- I'm sure I've impressed my team with that!
- Static site generators aren't new
- April 2013 for Jekyll

- Gatsby is more of a PWA generator
- Detail the workflow
- Netlify with a pre built template
- Netlify with Gatsby
- Netlify with this presentation
- Now.sh with a pre built template
- Now.sh with Gatsby
- Now.sh with this presentation
- Netlify with a pre built template
- search HTML5 template, pick http://www.initializr.com/
- download bootstrap version
- load it to Netlify
- Mind blown
