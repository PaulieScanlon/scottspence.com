title: Enable GUIs on Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL)

So this post started off with me getting GUI apps running on my
Windows WSL install of [Pengwin], but has now turned into doing it
without the need to fork over [the readies] for Pengwin as now you can
do it with Ubuntu or Debian (possibly others).

Pengwin is a pretty powerful Linux distro based off of Debian you can
pick it up in the Windows store for £16.74 if you want all the
additional features it offers up. I'd suggest keeping and eye on it
because they regularly do discount on it too.

I say this started off using Pengwin, because I used all the setup
options to enable GUI useage on there but (like most of my WSL
instances) I trashed the install and couldn't recreate what I had done
before. This post stayed shelved since the start of October but now
I'm picking it up again thanks to [Nicky Meuleman]'s guide on [Using
Graphical User Interfaces like Cypress' in WSL2] and his other post on
[Linux on windows WSL2 ZSH Docker] this also spawned the last post I
did on my [Notes on Zsh and Oh My Zsh].

So, what am I doing in this post? Ripping off Nicky's content? Pretty
much!

I'll be adding content from Nicky's posts here along with my own take
on things. I have several bits of content I have to gather up each
time I want to do this (I've done it several time now) so this will be
a complete list for my use case.

I'll be doing this with a fresh install of [Debian] from the Windows
store, this was me wanting to understand if I could do it there as
well as with Ubuntu more than anything else.

I can confirm it works with Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 20.04 as well as
Debian, the version of debian I'm using is Debian GNU/Linux 10, if you
want to check your version use `cat /etc/issue` in the terminal.

Again massive thanks to Nick Meuleman for his awesome content on this.

## Why GUI apps though?

Ok, so first up why do I want to be able to run [GUI]s (Graphical User
Interface) on my Linux instances?

For testing software like [Cypress], [QA Wolf] and browser automation
tools [Microsoft's Playwright] all need to run from the WSL instance
which isn't set up by default to run GUIs.

There is talk of the WSL team [Adding Linux GUI app support to WSL]
but this is slated for an update in the holidays (Christmas??).

I'm not going to hold my breath for this to go into the main release
of Windows 10 I'd hazard a guess that it'll be available Spring/Summer
release.

If you absolutely must have this functionality yourself then I'd
suggest giving [Windows insiders] a try. I've been on Windows insiders
in the past and would prefer to stay on the normal release schedule
for now.

There's a some things I'll need up front, an [X Server] I already have
[X410] which I got on offer from the Windows store, it retails around
£8.39.

Check out Nicky's blog on getting set up with [VcXsrv] if you're not
going to hand over the cash for X410. There's an important note on the
additional settings needed for that.
