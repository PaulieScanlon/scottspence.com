I started adding videos to my YouTube channel in November 2018, this
was mainly intended as an accompaniment to the blog post I did to [Get
your GraphCMS data into Gatsby].

Here's the video in all it's glory and 1.6k views:

This isn't a post on how to grow your audience, I'm still working on
that! Although I will recommend the [Developer's Guide to Starting a
YouTube Channel] a great book by James Q Quick on the subject, which
has loads of great actionable content.

I'm writing this because I was asked by a friend of mine (Rich Haines)
who said "It's something I've thought about but don't really know the
process."
