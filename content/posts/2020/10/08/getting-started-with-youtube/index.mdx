I started adding videos to [my YouTube channel] in November 2018, this
was mainly intended as an accompaniment to the blog post I did to [Get
your GraphCMS data into Gatsby].

A the time I was using a web cam I'd bought off of Amazon for around
Â£17, the quality wasn't great but it helped me get my point across.

I used my [Transformer Pro] with [OBS] then went on and uploaded it to
YouTube and embedded the video into the blog post.

This isn't a post on how to grow your audience, I'm still working on
that myself! Although I will recommend the [Developer's Guide to
Starting a YouTube Channel] a great book by James Q Quick on the
subject, which has loads of great actionable content.

## Why am I writing this?

I'm writing this because I was asked by a friend of mine (Rich Haines)
his words "You should do a guide on getting started with YouTube
vids." he also said it's something he's considered but didn't know
where to start.

> It's something I've thought about but don't really know the process.

Rich asked me to cover a few points, some of them I can give what I
know, other areas are still a WIP for me.

These are the bullets, I'll be digging into these a bit more but for
simplicities sake I have literally copy pasted them from the
conversation I had with Rich:

- [How to get started](#how-to-get-started)
- [What do I need](#what-do-i-need)
- [How do I set it up](#how-do-i-set-it-up)
- [Editing](#editing)
- [Marketing](#marketing)

At this point in time I have got 80 videos on YouTube, I'm at the
start pretty much.

Like with most of the content I write, I'm making this for people one
or a couple of steps behind me but ultimately for future me.

## Disclaimer

This is my opinionated guide, the tools and approaches I use may not
work for you. My primary OS now for making content is Windows
([powered by WSL]) I used Linux in the past but the experience was a
bit too rough around the edges to justify using it.

## How to get started

In the words of Joel Hooks, JFDI, this is the same advice you will
hear from a lot of YouTubers when someone asks "How to be a YouTuber?"
they'll say, start, iterate, get better.

In the words of MKBHD

> You'll never start off with a prefect first video.

<YouTube
  youTubeId="4l8eeqgCJnQ"
  skipTo={{
    h: 0,
    m: 6,
    s: 18,
  }}
/>

What you also need to bear in mind is that MKBHD has also been
consistently adding videos to YouTube since [2009].

Here's some sage advice from Twitter motivator Danny Thompson.

Also from Rich himself when feeling particularly insightful.

<Tweet tweetLink="studio_hungry/status/1314940921100865538" />

They both covey the same message.

## What do I need

As this is my opinionated guide I'll be detailing what I use for the
content I'm producing (mainly coding guides).

The basics you would need would be:

- a computer
- a mic
- screen capture software

Here's my list of tools I use for recording videos, nothing that's
going to break the bank but not incredibly cheap either.

- [Fifine USB Mic], at Â£24.99 when I purchased it in 2018, it's now
  around Â£50.
- [OBS]: Free and open source.
- [Aukey Webcam], at Â£45 there are other options of comparable quality
  I've got a couple sub Â£20 which were terrible.
- [XSplit VCam], best bit of software I've paid for recently. I got a
  licence for a quarter (at Â£9.95) and will be getting a lifetime
  licence (at Â£49.99) when it's time to renew.
- [USB Lighting], this clips to the desk and adds a little additional
  lighting, at Â£9.09 it'll do for now.
- [Large Microphone Boom Arm], not essential but is can cut vibrations
  from the desk (when typing) if the mic is on the desk.

The sound will be the most important thing when people are watching
your video so a decent mic will go a long way, I'm still really happy
with the quality of my Fifine USB mic I got back in 2018.

For screen recording all I have ever used is OBS on Windows, Linux and
macOS so I'm not able to recommend anything outside of that. Doing the
standard **"screen recording software"** search brings up loads of
options for free and paid software.

There is also Streamlabs OBS which has a lot of pre-made scenes and
integration with YouTube and Twitch.

Streamlabs OBS is alltogether a much nice looking experience but I
found it a bit tedious digging around for settings.

Streamlabs OBS is a fork of OBS so if there are any improvements in
OBS they may take a while to be implemented in Streamlabs OBS.

## How do I set it up

I'm going to presume this is "how do I set up the screen recording
software?" so in my case this is "how do I set up OBS?"

When you first open OBS after downloading it you're prompted to use
the Auto-Configuration Wizard which will determine the best settings
based on your hardware and internet speed.

![obs-auto-configuration-wizard]

There are two options, if you're not interested in streaming on Twitch
then I'd suggest selecting the second option. The last option is for
sharing your scenes with other software like Zoom.

[Open Broadcaster Software] (OBS) is a whole post in itself I think!

For the very basics you're going to need a scene with a display
capture.

The bottom left corner will show you the Scenes collection, this is
where you can create differing appearances of how the screen appears
when you make a recording.

![empty-starting-scene]

You can right click on the Scene name and select Rename to give it a
more meaningful name if you wish.

First thing that will need to be added to the Scene is a display to
record. In the Sources panel (next to Scenes) click the plus button
and select Display Capture, the next dialogue will prompt you to
select a screen to display in the scene.

### Scenes

Now that I've gone over the basics of a scene there's a few I use for
when I'm doing a screen recording, there's a few more for streaming.

For doing a screencap for a guide which is going to be a pre-recorded
YouTube video I'll use a scene with my desktop input source and
sometimes with a video capture device.

If you're streaming and want to have a countdown timer, there's a
script you can use in OBS

<YouTube youTubeId="rUHy_tBzXus" />

There are a few scenarios if you're streaming where you're not able to
stay on the camera, like when that delivery you've been waiting to
turn up happens ten minutes into a stream!

When this happens it's handy to have a Be Right Back banner to show
while you go pick up your parcel from the delivery driver.

## Editing

Editing, whats that then? ðŸ˜‚

Seriously, time is a factor for me when recording videos, I'm super
limited on the amount of time I can take. I've found it simpler to do
a one take than spend time editing videos.

I have had comments both for and against the unedited approach, in
some cases, where I've made a typo and it's taken a while to realise
the mistake that time is enough to turn people away from your video or
compel them enough to leave a comment.

Comments are great as it's engagement for the video that wouldn't be
there otherwise.

On the odd occasion that I have used video editing it would be to
remove something mid video on an otherwise useful video.

Video editing software I'd recommend that I have used personally would
be [OpenShot] and [Shotcut], both open source and cross platform.
