I started adding videos to [my YouTube channel] in November 2018, this
was mainly intended as an accompaniment to the blog post I did to [Get
your GraphCMS data into Gatsby].

Here's the video in all it's glory and 1.6k views:

A the time I was using a web cam I'd bought off of Amazon for around
Â£17, the quality wasn't great but it helped me get my point across.

I used my [Transformer Pro] with [OBS] then went on and uploaded it to
YouTube and embedded the video into the blog post.

This isn't a post on how to grow your audience, I'm still working on
that myself! Although I will recommend the [Developer's Guide to
Starting a YouTube Channel] a great book by James Q Quick on the
subject, which has loads of great actionable content.

## Why am I writing this?

I'm writing this because I was asked by a friend of mine (Rich Haines)
stateing "You should do a guide on getting started with YouTube vids."
he also said it's something he's considered but didn't know where to
start.

> "It's something I've thought about but don't really know the
> process."

Rich asked me to cover a few points, some of them I can give what I
know, other areas are still a WIP for me.

These are the bullets, I'll be digging into these a bit more but for
simplicities sake I have literally copy pasted them from the
conversation I had with Rich:

- [How to get started](#how-to-get-started)
- [What do I need](#what-do-i-need)
- [How do I set it up](#how-do-i-set-it-up)
- [Editing](#editing)
- [Marketing](#marketing)

At this point in time I have got 80 videos on YouTube, I'm at the
start pretty much.

Like with most of the content I write, I'm making this for people one
or a couple of steps behind me and for future me.

## How to get started

In the words of Joel Hooks JFDI, this is the same advice you will hear
from a lot of YouTubers as well, start, iterate get better. You'll
never start off with a prefect first video.

Some sage advice from Twitter motivator Danny Thompson.

Also from Rich himself when feeling particularly insightful.

They both covey the same message.

## Disclaimer

This is my opinionated guide, the tools and approaches I use may not
work for you

## What do I need

As this is my opinionated guide I'll be detailing what I use for the
content I'm producing (mainly coding guides).

The basics would be:

- a computer
- a mic
- screen capture software

My list of tools I use for recording videos

- OBS
- XSplit VCam
- Aukey Webcam
- Fifine Mic

## How do I set it up

- OBS?

## Editing

Editing, whats that then? ðŸ˜‚

Seriously, time is a factor for me when recording videos, I'm super
limited on the amount of time I can take. I've found it simpler to do
a one take than spend time editing videos.

I have had comments both for and against the unedited approach, in
some cases, where I've made a typo and it's taken a while to realise
the mistake that time is enough to turn people away from your video or
compel them enough to leave a comment. Comments are great as it's
engagement for the video that wouldn't be there otherwise.

On the odd occasion that I have used video editing it would be to
remove something mid video on an otherwise useful video.

Video editing software I'd recommend that I have used personally would
be [OpenShot] and [Shotcut], both open source and cross platform.
