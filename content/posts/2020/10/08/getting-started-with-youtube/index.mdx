I started adding videos to [my YouTube channel] in November 2018, this
was mainly intended as an accompaniment to the blog post I did to [Get
your GraphCMS data into Gatsby].

A the time I was using a web cam I'd bought off of Amazon for around
Â£17, the quality wasn't great but it helped me get my point across.

I used my [Transformer Pro] with [OBS] then went on and uploaded it to
YouTube and embedded the video into the blog post.

This isn't a post on how to grow your audience, I'm still working on
that myself! Although I will recommend the [Developer's Guide to
Starting a YouTube Channel] a great book by James Q Quick on the
subject, which has loads of great actionable content.

## Why am I writing this?

I'm writing this because I was asked by a friend of mine (Rich Haines)
his words "You should do a guide on getting started with YouTube
vids." he also said it's something he's considered but didn't know
where to start.

> It's something I've thought about but don't really know the process.

Rich asked me to cover a few points, some of them I can give what I
know, other areas are still a WIP for me.

These are the bullets, I'll be digging into these a bit more but for
simplicities sake I have literally copy pasted them from the
conversation I had with Rich:

- [How to get started](#how-to-get-started)
- [Disclaimer](#disclaimer)
- [What do I need](#what-do-i-need)
- [How do I set it up](#how-do-i-set-it-up)
- [Editing](#editing)
- [Marketing](#marketing)

At this point in time I have got 80 videos on YouTube, I'm at the
start pretty much.

Like with most of the content I write, I'm making this for people one
or a couple of steps behind me but ultimately for future me.

## How to get started

In the words of Joel Hooks, JFDI, this is the same advice you will
hear from a lot of YouTubers when someone asks "How to be a YouTuber?"
they'll say, start, iterate, get better.

In the words of MKBHD

> You'll never start off with a prefect first video.

<YouTube
  youTubeId="4l8eeqgCJnQ"
  skipTo={{
    h: 0,
    m: 6,
    s: 18,
  }}
/>

Some sage advice from Twitter motivator Danny Thompson.

Also from Rich himself when feeling particularly insightful.

They both covey the same message.

## Disclaimer

This is my opinionated guide, the tools and approaches I use may not
work for you. My primary OS now for making content is Windows
([powered by WSL]) so I used Linux in the past but the experience was
a bit too rough around the edges to justify using it.

## What do I need

As this is my opinionated guide I'll be detailing what I use for the
content I'm producing (mainly coding guides).

The basics would be:

- a computer
- a mic
- screen capture software

My list of tools I use for recording videos, nothing that's going to
break the bank but not incredibly cheap either.

- [Fifine USB Mic], at Â£24.99 when I purchased it in 2018, it's now
  around Â£50.
- [OBS]: Free and open source.
- [Aukey Webcam], at Â£45 there are other options of comparable quality
  I've got a couple sub Â£20 which were terrible.
- [XSplit VCam], best bit of software I've paid for recently. I got a
  licence for a quarter (at Â£9.95) and will be getting a lifetime
  licence (at Â£49.99) when it's time to renew.
- [USB Lighting], this clips to the desk and adds a little additional
  lighting, at Â£9.09 it'll do for now.

The sound will be the most important thing when people are watching
your video so a decent mic will go a long way, I'm still really happy
with the quality of my Fifine USB mic.

For screen recording all I have ever used is OBS on Windows, Linux and
macOS so I'm not able to recommend anything outside of that. Doing the
standard **"screen recording software"** Google search brings up loads
of options for free and paid software.

## How do I set it up

I'm going to presume this is "how do I set up the screen recording
software?" so in my case this is "how do I set up OBS?"

When you first open OBS after downloading it you're prompted to use

### OBS

Open Broadcaster Software is a whole post in itself I think!

### Lighting

### Sound

## Editing

Editing, whats that then? ðŸ˜‚

Seriously, time is a factor for me when recording videos, I'm super
limited on the amount of time I can take. I've found it simpler to do
a one take than spend time editing videos.

I have had comments both for and against the unedited approach, in
some cases, where I've made a typo and it's taken a while to realise
the mistake that time is enough to turn people away from your video or
compel them enough to leave a comment.

Comments are great as it's engagement for the video that wouldn't be
there otherwise.

On the odd occasion that I have used video editing it would be to
remove something mid video on an otherwise useful video.

Video editing software I'd recommend that I have used personally would
be [OpenShot] and [Shotcut], both open source and cross platform.
