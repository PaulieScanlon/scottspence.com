I had a work colleague introduce me to Linaria last week and I've
decided to use it in a project.

Getting started with Linaria

Like styled-components but different

I like styled-components because you're writing CSS not camelCase
style keys.

Linaria is a no runtime

Gotchas for Linaria

## Global styling

Linaria uses the `css` helper for global styles, but the documentation
doesn't really show you how to implement it over, "this is how you
make a global style", I found that you can append it to the
`ThemeProvider` class like so:

```jsx
<ThemeProvider theme={theme} className={globals}>
  <>{element}</>
</ThemeProvider>
```

## Theming

You can create your own theme with Linaria using React Context but I
have decided to go with the Callstack theme provider.

You can implement it like so:

```js
import { createTheming } from '@callstack/react-theme-provider'
import { defaults } from './default-config'

const theme = {
  ...defaults,
}

export const { ThemeProvider, withTheme, useTheme } = createTheming(
  theme
)
```

In this example I'm spreading in the [defaults from Tailwind CSS] this
means I have all the defaults available in Tailwind from the
ThemeProvider.

## Theme hook

To use the theme I've utilised the `useTheme` hook provided by the
theme provider.

```jsx
import { styled } from 'linaria/react'
import React from 'react'
import { useTheme } from '../../theme/theme-provider'

const StyledText = styled.h3`
  font-size: ${({ theme }) => theme.fontSize['2xl']};
  font-family: ${({ theme }) => theme.fontFamily.serif};
  margin-top: ${({ theme }) => theme.spacing[8]};
  line-height: ${({ theme }) => theme.lineHeight.none};
`

export const H3 = props => {
  const theme = useTheme()
  return (
    <StyledText theme={theme} {...props}>
      {props.children}
    </StyledText>
  )
}
```
