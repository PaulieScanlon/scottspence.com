Unprecedented times, 2020 have been something else and hopefully
something we will not have to live through again.

I've decided to take a few notes on what I've done over this time.

## Became fully remote

Inset whity meme about _"Who led the digital transformation of your
company"_ here.

I'm privileged to be working in a company that was able to fully
embrace remote working.

Although, remote work was never an option when they were looking to
recruit and the first question you're asked if you tweet out a "we're
hiring" is "do you do remote?"

Me and my team have never been busyier and collaborating has been a
breeze with Microsoft Teams.

I know that this is doable for digital teams now and I'm looking to
stay away from London for as long as possible.

## Bought a `.com`

I bit the bullet and bought [scottspence.com], this was party due to
me deciding to rebrand my blog to a [digital garden] and wanting to be
a bit more serious about how I market myself.

Also it was another opportunity to start fresh with my content.
