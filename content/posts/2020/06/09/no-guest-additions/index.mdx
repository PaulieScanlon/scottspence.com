Virtual Box Guest Additions _can_ be a bit of a pain to set up
sometimes.

My current PC setup for some reason wouldn't show a VM in the full
resolution.

I went through a lot of post followed loads of instructions with none
of them working until I watched this video from ArcoLinux.

There's a couple of options I've never had to configure before but
once I did I got a full screen resolution without having to mess
around with installing Guest Additions.

First up is "Enable PAE/NX" then I also checked "Enable Nested
VT-x/AMD-V"

![system extended features]

Then the display setting pick the "VBoxSVGA" option from the "Graphics
Controller" dropdown.
