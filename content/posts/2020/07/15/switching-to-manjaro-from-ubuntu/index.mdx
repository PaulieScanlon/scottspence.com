I switched

## Didn't copy my dotfiles

## Issues

## Bluetooth

## Yarn

I was having Yarn Global binaries not sowing in the fish shell

- https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/5824
- To add to Fish:
  `set fish_user_paths $HOME/.yarn/bin $HOME/.config/yarn/global/node_modules/.bin $fish_user_paths`
- To remove it:
  `set fish_user_paths (string match -rv yarn $fish_user_paths)`
- Don't forget to add it to your path:
  - add this to the `.bashrc` file`PATH=$PATH:/home/scott/.yarn/bin`
    this was my first port of call but was still getting issues in
    Fish, wasn't until I checked in Bash that I knew the path was
    working. (What prompted me to check bash:
    https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/4702#issuecomment-343970090)
- Useful(ish) links from SO and GH:

## Bluetooth

Manjario Bluetooth issues I found this:
https://forum.manjaro.org/t/bluetooth-is-not-working-with-headphones/116661/4 -
which pointed me to install `pulseaudio-bluetooth-a2dp-gdm-fix` search
for "Bluetooth Headset" in the add/remove software section
