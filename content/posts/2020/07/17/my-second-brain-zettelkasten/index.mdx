For as long as I have been learning web development (<DateDistance
date={`2016-06-15`} />) I have been taking notes. Partly notes to help
clarify my understanding of something and partly for future me.

That's why I have my [digital garden], an online collection of my
learning over the years.

What is in my garden is not the full extent of the notes I have taken
however, there's partly formed musings and one-liners that will help
me if I ever come across this particular thing which took a while to
fix/resolve in the past.

Stuff like that doesn't really warrent going into a post so I have
[Cheat Sheets] where that will get added to and grouped with the
relevent information.

It's not been until recently that I have come to learn of the
[Zettelkasten] method, which translates from German to note box.

With tools like RoamResearch and Notion gaining popularity and me
using many of them I've decided to make some nots on my opinions of
what I have been using over the years.

## GitHub

GitHub is where it all began for me, with git being a particular
sticking point with a lot of commands that were all pretty alien to me
so I started adding the commands [to a gist] which has a hostory going
back to [the start of 2017].

As this list started to grow I also had other areas that I needed to
keep these little one-liners to hand, git being the largest but other
things like [how to screen snip] on macOS and [kill a process] with
bash, all started adding up.

I moved them all into [one repository] for ease of access for me.
These later were added to [Cheat Sheets].xyz

## Notion

## RoamResearch

## Obsidian
