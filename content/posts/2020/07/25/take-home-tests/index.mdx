I've written about this [in the past] and more recently how I've
turned what can seem like a massive drain on your resources it [into a
dev project].

These are my opinions but ones that I know are shared by the rest of
the tech community as a whole.

## Hiring in tech is hard

But it doesn't have to be

## Respect peoples time

Seriously

## Do the groundwork

Opinions on take home tests, I have them, so do other people!

Excerpts from Tweets [1], [2]:

I know hiring is hard from both sides. If you ask a candidate to do a
minimum 5-8 hour technical take home assignment then there shouldn't
be a need for a probationary period. Sound fair (for the employer)? Of
course not

If you hire someone just by talking to them and reviewing the code
they already have made available (Git, example projects) and it
doesn't work out then that's what a probationary period is for. Sound
fair?

It's all about risk aversion, but a lot of the burden for this is on
the candidate.

I wouldn't mind doing live coding in an interview, there's obviously
pressure in that too and some people can't do it. With take home tests
(more often than not) the company think that you're only interviewing
with them and you've got nothing better to do with your spare time.

I live coded for my current role and it went really badly, but the
team lead was able to see my thought process and how I worked through
things. A take home test doesn't demonstrate that and looking at the
code afterwards the reviewer isn't going to know that.

This again puts all the pressure on the candidate, leaving it open
ended like that means that "it's up to you how much you want this
role" How much time will the reviewer spend looking at it? Will you
get feedback? ðŸ˜‚

I've witnessed candidates get rejected for using tabs instead of
spaces before. It's bonkers, instead of looking for reasons not to
hire, make the right candidate choices FIRST before investing any
time.
