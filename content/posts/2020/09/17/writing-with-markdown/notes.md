# Introduction

Okeee Dokeee

Hey everyone my name is Scott Spence and this is the Markdown showdown

In this mini series I'll be going over all the things you need to know
about Markdown

Even if you're familiar with Markdown this may help fill in some gaps
along the way

I'm a huge Markdown user using it daily for writing. Markdown is a
great tool for writing blog posts, using in GitHub replies, issues and
README's.

It can also be used in Discord, Slack and even WhatsApp.

Markdown is intended to be easy to read by itself but also converts
into HTML

You can use HTML in Markdown as well!

I'll go into all the different parts of Markdown, it's a pretty
straightforward language and show you my tools and workflow along the
way.

Just one other thing to note is that Markdown is either limited or
enhanced depending on where you're using it.

For this course I'll be using the GitHub flavoured Markdown that is
built into VS Code.

OK! Let's get started!

# Tooling

Let's talk about tooling, the best tool to write Markdown is the
editor you are already comfortable with.

If you're a web developer you're probably already comfortable with
text editors like VS Code, Atom or Sublime Text and I suggest that is
where you write your Markdown.

Why go to a different tool when you can use what you're comfortable
with already. This is why I switched from Obsidian to Foam for my
second brain, you can check out that video if you're interested in
learning about that. Link in the description!

For me I'll be using VS Code in these videos but you can use what
you're comfortable with as I just mentioned.

If you're not using a text editor then there are a couple of Markdown
viewers out there you can use I found a nice one called [Markdown
Forge] by Justin Juno and a fully featured editor called [StackEdit]
which supports diagrams with Mermaid, pretty neat!

## VS Code settings

```json
"workbench.settings.editor": "json",
"editor.formatOnSave": true,
```
