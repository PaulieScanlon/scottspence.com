Here it is kids! All I know about Markdown. First! The standard
preamble...

Before that though! Some of the possible titles I came up with before
writing this:

- Uptown with Markdown
- Downtown with Markdown
- Splashdown with Markdown
- Don't frown with Markdown
- Get the Markdown Crown

Sorry, anyways! Onwards!!

As a developer, a developer of web, and someone that writes a lot in
my [digital garden] I use Markdown on a daily basis, but what is
Markdown?

## Introduction: What's Markdown then?

Essentially Markdown is a way to format your text, like you would in
Microsoft Word but without using the toolbar to select the format for
the text.

The goal for Markdown is to enable easy to write and easy to read
plain text format that is converted to HTML in the browser.

There are a many differing flavours of Markdown which you may have
come across before on the web, places like Discord, GitHub, Jira,
Reddit, StackExchange, and even WhatsApp and Facebook all use some
form of Markdown!

I'll be focusing on GitHub Flavoured Markdown Specification ([GFM]) in
this guide.

Like I mentioned earlier Markdown is converted into valid HTML and if
you have not encountered Markdown before it before looks something
like this in your text editor:

```md
## This is a h2 headding
```

The equivalent in HTML will be:

```html
<h2>This is a h2 headding</h2>
```

Which will be converted to a h2 as you see in the web browser. Take a
look at this interactive component here ðŸ‘‡ try editing the text on the
left:

<MarkdownParser markdownContent={`## This is a h2 heading`} />

## Markdown Tooling

There are may places to use Markdown as I mentioned earlier, for the
examples here I'll be using the interactive component, if you want to
follow along I'll be using VSCode and Prettier.

## Markdown Headings

<MarkdownParser
  markdownContent={`# h1 heading
## h2 heading
### h3 heading
#### h4 heading
##### h5 heading
###### h6 heading
`}
/>

## Markdown Links

<MarkdownParser
  markdownContent={`my [digital garden](https://scottspence.com/garden)`}
/>
