title: How to Monetise Your Content With Coil and Brave BAT

I recently started monetising my blog, this isn't a new thing as I
originally did it with Brave and the Basic Attention Token (BAT) back
in 2018 on scottspence.me

This time around I've reinlisted the Brave BAT but also started using
Coil

It looks like the `monetization` tag on Dev.to is their own tag whilst
they test the viability of it before letting authors to set their own
pointers.

Here's the source comments from one of my Dev.to posts:

```html
<!-- Experimental web monetization payment pointer for micropayments -->
<!-- It lets readers make micropayments to websites they visit. -->
<!-- This is step 1: Get live in production to test for platform-wide payment pointer. -->
<!-- Step 2: Allow authors to set their payment pointer so they can directly monetize their content based on visitors. -->
<!-- Step 3: Enable further functionality based on what we learn from this experimentation and how the ecosystem evolves. -->
```

I have a `monetization` meta tag on my site now.

```html
<meta name="monetization" content="$ilp.uphold.com/bzPBWkMBzLmN" />
```

For Brave BAT I've had it in a `.well-known` folder along with my
Keybase identity.
