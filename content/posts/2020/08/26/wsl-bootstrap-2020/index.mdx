Yo! It's that time again!!

I've been using Manjaro for a grand total of three months now so now
I've switched back to Windows ðŸ˜‚

Why?

Why not! ðŸ˜œ

I have done a web development set up on Windows a few times now:

- [Windows Subsystem Linux setup]
- [Windows Web-dev bootstrap]

This time round it was just as confusing at the times before, so this
is why I'm making notes for future Scott to refer to. ðŸ”¥

## Advantages of Windows over Linux or MacOs

I'm not going to get into a debate on the advantages of one platform
over another.

I can be productive on all of them given the right tools and that's
fine with me. Consider it like building a project for a client, they
really don't care what framework you used to make it as long as it
works and I feel the same about that with using Windows or Linux.

## Why WSL?

So me saying that I do sound like a total hypocrite when what I am
using for web dev on Windows is, in fact, Linux!

Windows Subsystem Linux 2 to be precise

## Terminal

I like Hyper, I know a lot of people use the VSCode integrated
terminal but

## Shell

## Symlinks (Symbolic Link)

A quick note on symlinks ([symbolic links]), with WSL you can have
several several instances of a Linux distro on your machine.

There's several for Ubuntu, with Ubuntu (20.04), Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS then on top of that there are [another several
distros] recommended by Microsoft with additional ones on top of that
like [Pengwin] which is a great extension on what's already available
in the recommended distros from Microsoft.

**What does that have to do with symlinks though?** Well, if you think
about each one of these instances you could have each their own
isolated oppearting system on your machine.

Each one with it's own set of configurations, it will get pretty
tedious keeping them all current.

The majority of my settings on these instances will be for git,
`.gitconfig` and SSH settings for [authenticating with GitHub via
SSH].

Rather than have several differing SSH keys I have the one key in a
shared location for all the WSL instances that need to use it.
