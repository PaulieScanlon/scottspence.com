Yo! It's that time again!!

I've been using Manjaro for a grand total of three months now so now
I've switched back to Windows ðŸ˜‚

Why?

Why not! ðŸ˜œ

I have done a web development set up on Windows a few times now:

- [Windows Subsystem Linux setup]
- [Windows Web-dev bootstrap]

This time round it was just as confusing at the times before, so this
is why I'm making notes for future Scott to refer to. ðŸ”¥

## Advantages of Windows over Linux or MacOs

I'm not going to get into a debate on the advantages of one platform
over another.

I can be productive on all of them given the right tools and that's
fine with me. Consider it like building a project for a client, they
really don't care what framework you used to make it as long as it
works and I feel the same about that with using Windows or Linux.

## Why WSL?

So me saying that I do sound like a total hypocrite when what I am
using for web dev on Windows is, in fact, Linux!

Windows Subsystem Linux 2 to be precise

## Terminal

I like Hyper, I know a lot of people use the VSCode integrated
terminal but

## Shell

## Symlinks (Symbolic Link)
