Yo! It's that time again!!

This is an opinionated guide on setting up a development environment
for web development in widows that will use the requisite tools, Bash,
Node, Git, VSCode etc...

Tl;Dr to the [guide] if you're not interested in the preamble and how
I got here.

I've been using Manjaro (Linux distribution) for a grand total of
three months or so now; so now I've switched back to Windows ðŸ˜‚

> Why?
>
> Why not! ðŸ˜œ

I added another SSD to my PC so I have one with Linux and one with
Windows, I'm giving Windows a good roll because of things like the
XSplit VCam for a virtual camera background and OBS having Twitch
integration, not directly related to web dev but I like to create
content and the options in Windows are better than with Linux.

I have done a web development set up on Windows a couple of times in
the past:

- [Windows Subsystem Linux setup]
- [Windows Web-dev bootstrap]

This time round it was just as confusing (for me) at the times before,
so this is why I'm making notes for future Scott to refer to. ðŸ”¥

## Advantages of Windows over Linux or MacOs

I'm not going to get into a debate on the advantages of one platform
over another.

I can be productive on all of them given the right tools and that's
fine with me. Consider it like building a project for a client, they
really don't care what framework you used to make it as long as it
works and I feel the same about that with using Windows, Linux or
MacOs.

## Why WSL?

So me saying that I do sound like a total hypocrite when what I am
using for web dev on Windows is, in fact, Linux!

Windows Subsystem Linux 2 to be precise, I was really excited for this
ever since seeing the announcement back in May 2019.

<Tweet tweetLink="windowsdev/status/1125484494616649728" />

> Dramatically improved file read performance up to a 3x improvement!

So what does WSL offer over using everything in Windows, I couldn't
say really, I think the developer experience (DX) in WSL offers a bit
more than that of Windows.

I have become a lot more accustomed to doing my web dev in a Linux
environment and I'm very comfortable using the terminal to get what
needs doing, done.

## Prerequisites

## Chocolatey

## Terminal

I like Hyper, I know a lot of people use the VSCode integrated
terminal but

## Shell

## Symlinks (Symbolic Link)

A quick note on symlinks ([symbolic links]), and why I'm using them.
So a symlink is a pointer to a file somewhere else, an example would
be in Windows when you install a program you get a shortcut on your
desktop to that program, a symlink is like that.

The reasoning for using them is with WSL you can have several several
instances of a Linux distro on your machine.

There's several for Ubuntu, with Ubuntu (20.04), Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS then on top of that there are [another several
distros] recommended by Microsoft with additional ones on top of that
like [Pengwin] (which is a great extension on what's already available
in the recommended distros from Microsoft).

**What does that have to do with symlinks though?** Well, if you think
about each one of these instances you could have each their own
isolated oppearting system on your machine.

Each one with it's own set of configurations, it will get pretty
tedious keeping them all current.

The majority of my settings on these instances will be for git,
`.gitconfig` and SSH settings for [authenticating with GitHub via
SSH].

Rather than have several differing SSH keys I have the one key in a
shared location for all the WSL instances that need to use it.

## Hints and tips

Use Yarn? Don't seem to be able to use `yarn` in the terminal? Try
adding [this line] to your `.bashrc` file:

```bash
# open the .bashrc file to edit with nano
nano ~/.bashrc
# add the following line at the bottom of the file
export PATH="$(yarn global bin):$PATH"
# ctrl+o to write the change
# ctrl+x to exit
# reload the terminal with
source ~/.bashrc
```
