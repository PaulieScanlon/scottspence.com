title: Chakra UI and Gatsby - Getting Started

Ok, so this is another one of those "let's use a new CSS-in-JS library
on a Gatsby default starter project" post.

In this case it's Chakra UI, it's recently gone v1 and I'm keen to use
it.

What I'm going to be doing is styling the [Gatsby starter default]
using Chakra UI and chucking in a theme toggle as well.

This will involve swapping out the styles that come with the [Gatsby
starter default] with Chakra UI ones.

The end result I'l aiming for is for it to look exactly the same as
before but using Chakra UI in place of the styling it comes with.

## Pre requisites

The usual notes on development environment, this comes with the
presumption you'll already have a development environment set up and
configured. If you don't have a development environment then you can
always use [CodeSandbox.io] to get up and running with an environment.

In the examples here I'm using Node version `14.13.0`.

Here's some of the dependencies being used in this guide, they're all
latest versions at the time of writing this.

```json
"@chakra-ui/gatsby-plugin": "^1.0.0",
"@chakra-ui/icons": "^1.0.1",
"@chakra-ui/react": "^1.0.1",
"@emotion/react": "^11.1.1",
"@emotion/styled": "^11.0.0",
"framer-motion": "^2.9.4",
"gatsby": "^2.26.1",
"react": "^17.0.1",
"react-dom": "^17.0.1",
```

## Create the thing

Spin up a new Gatsby project with `npx`:

```bash
npx gatsby new gatsby-chakra-ui
```

You can install and use the Gatsby CLI if you like, in this instance
I'm going `npx` as I'm not going to need any of the Gatsby CLI
functionality.

Wait for that to finish doing it's thing then change directory to the
freshly created gatsby project. Cool, cool, do a quick `yarn develop`
to make sure everything's installed ok with no issues.

## Install the things

```bash
yarn add \
  @chakra-ui/react \
  @emotion/react \
  @emotion/styled \
  framer-motion \
  @chakra-ui/gatsby-plugin \
  @chakra-ui/icons
```

Add the Chakra UI Gatsby plugin to the Gatsby plugin array in
`gatsby-config.js`

```js
plugins: [
  `@chakra-ui/gatsby-plugin`,
  // many more plugins ðŸ‘‡
```

All the styles are gone, that's the Gatsby plugin doing it's thing.

I'll remove the `import "./layout.css"` from the `layout.js`
component. I can then delete the `layout.css` file as it's not needed.

## Root Wrapper time!

## Theme Toggle

```jsx
import { MoonIcon, SunIcon } from '@chakra-ui/icons'
import {
  IconButton,
  useColorMode,
  useColorModeValue,
} from '@chakra-ui/react'
import React from 'react'

export default function ThemeToggle() {
  const { toggleColorMode: toggleMode } = useColorMode()
  const ToggleIcon = useColorModeValue(SunIcon, MoonIcon)

  return (
    <IconButton
      icon={<ToggleIcon />}
      variant="ghost"
      aria-label="Toggle Theme"
      onClick={toggleMode}
    />
  )
}
```
