The Gatsby File System Route API was [announced recently] and I have
been having a play around with it. If you're not familiar with it,
it's something like the [dynamic routing you get with Next.js]. If
you're not familiar with that either then it's a way to generate your
page routes from data.

In this walkthrough I'm going to set up the Gatsby File System Route
API on a project using MDX and Chakra UI.

Why Chakra UI? I made a [Getting Started Chakra UI Gatsby] post
recently and it's something I want to invest a bit more time into to
aid me in developing faster.

## Bootstrap with a starter

With the getting started post I created a Gatsby starter I'll base
this project off of that with the Gatsby CLI:

```bash
gatsby new gatsby-file-system-route-api-mdx https://github.com/spences10/gatsby-starter-chakra-ui
```

## Content

Cool, cool, cool, now to demonstrate the System Route API I'm going to
need to have some content to generate the paths with.

I'm going to jack the last three months of content from my digital
garden and add it to the root of this project.

I have a particular way _I_ like to structure my posts which is
`YYYY/MM/DD/folder-for-the-post/index.mdx` this is nested in a
`content` folder. (You can structure your files how you like, you do
you.) I use the words folder and directory interchangeably.

So the file structure looks a bit like this:

```text
gatsby-file-system-route-api-mdx/
├─ content/2020/
│  ├─ 09
│  │  └─ 02/how-to-monetise-your-content/
│  │    └─ index.mdx
│  ├─ 10
│  └─ 11
├─ src/
│  ├─ assets/
│  ├─ components/
│  ├─ images/
│  ├─ pages/
│  └─ woot-wapper.tsx
... more files
```

## Gatsby Source Filesystem

Cool, now there's a bit of content time to point the
`gatsby-source-filesystem` to it, so in this instance, as the source
plugin for it is already installed I'll copy the section pointing to
the images folder and point another configuration to the `content`
folder in the `gatsby-config.js` file:

```json
{
  "resolve": `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
  "options": {
    "name": `images`,
    "path": `${__dirname}/content`
  }
}
```

## Gatsby MDX Plugin

Now I'm going to need something to parse the MDX files I'm using, time
to install the Gatsby MDX plugin, I'll also need the related `@mdx`
dependencies:

```bash
yarn add gatsby-plugin-mdx \
  @mdx-js/mdx \
  @mdx-js/react
```

And to configure that in the Gatsby plugin array in the
`gatsby-config.js` file:

```json
{
  "resolve": `gatsby-plugin-mdx`,
  "options": {
    "extensions": [`.mdx`, `.md`]
  }
}
```

Fun fact you don't actually need to have the `extensions` option
configured which I discovered on a stream with James Q Quick! I like
to have it in there to be explicit.

## Time to spin up the dev server!

## Pages file notation

```
{mdx.slug}.js
```

```js
import { Text } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import { MDXRenderer } from 'gatsby-plugin-mdx'
import React from 'react'

export default function PostPage({ data }) {
  const {
    body,
    frontmatter: { title },
  } = data.mdx
  return (
    <>
      <Text fontSize="4xl">{title}</Text>
      <MDXRenderer>{body}</MDXRenderer>
    </>
  )
}

export const query = graphql`
  query PostBySlug($slug: String) {
    mdx(slug: { eq: $slug }) {
      id
      slug
      body
      frontmatter {
        date
        title
      }
    }
  }
`
```

## Recap and wrap!

That’s it for this one! To recap what I did:

- Created a project from a starter with the Gatsby CLI
- Added some content
- Configured the Gatsby Source Filesystem
- Added and configured the Gatsby MDX Plugin
- Validated the pages were created via the Graph<em>i</em>QL explorer

The source code for this walkthough can be found on GitHub in the
Gatsby [File System Route Starter] I made.
