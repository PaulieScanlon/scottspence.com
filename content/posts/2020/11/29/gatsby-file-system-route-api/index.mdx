The Gatsby File System Route API was announced recently and I have
been having a play around with it. If you're not familiar with it,
it's something like the dynamic routing you get with Next.js. If
you're not familiar with that either then it's a was to generate your
page routes from data.

In this walkthrough I'm going to set up the Gatsby File System Route
API on a project using MDX and Chakra UI.

## Content

## Gatsby Source Filesystem

```json
{
  "resolve": `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
  "options": {
    "name": `images`,
    "path": `${__dirname}/content`
  }
}
```

## Gatsby MDX Plugin

```json
{
  "resolve": `gatsby-plugin-mdx`,
  "options": {
    "extensions": [`.mdx`, `.md`]
  }
}
```

## Pages file notation

```
{mdx.slug}.js
```

```js
import { Text } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import { MDXRenderer } from 'gatsby-plugin-mdx'
import React from 'react'

export default function PostPage({ data }) {
  const {
    body,
    frontmatter: { title },
  } = data.mdx
  return (
    <>
      <Text fontSize="4xl">{title}</Text>
      <MDXRenderer>{body}</MDXRenderer>
    </>
  )
}

export const query = graphql`
  query PostBySlug($slug: String) {
    mdx(slug: { eq: $slug }) {
      id
      slug
      body
      frontmatter {
        date
        title
      }
    }
  }
`
```
