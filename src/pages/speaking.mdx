# Speaking

I have spoken at several meetups now and would be keen to do more, if
you are having a meetup and want speakers <GetInTouch>get in
touch</GetInTouch>.

Here's the list of talks I have done publically.

## The Front End podcast

A podcast that explores the in's and out's of life as a developer.

For the final episode in season one I talk to Rob Kendal and share my
path into development from VBA analyst to web developer.

Unsurprisingly I'm talking about the JAMstack and Gatsby JS.
